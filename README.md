Sliding Window Compression

Compression & Decompression
APCS Lab 2015-2016
created by Abhay Varshney

## Description

The idea of a sliding window algorithm is to keep track of characters previously seen in an input source. 
If a string of characters has previously appeared within the sliding window, store a pointer back to where
the string occurs in the window. The pointer specifies where in the window to find the string and how many 
characters long the string is. I have written 2 java projects which can compress a txt file and decompress 
a txt file.


## Quickstart
Follow steps below to run Compression or Decompression.

## 1. Choose Compression or Decompression

## 2. Save project locally
Clone this repository locally and run `SlidingWindowCompression.java` program using a Java Editor such as BlueJ.

## 3. Hex Editor to see output
You must also use a hex editor because it allows you to view and edit the raw bytes of any file. To debug your lab output
you will very likely need the services of a hex editor so you can see your compressed files in binary form. This way 
you'll be able to see unprintable characters such as (char) 7, the audible bell.
