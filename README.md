Sliding Window Compression
======
APCS Lab 2015-2016
created by Abhay Varshney

## Description

The idea of a sliding window algorithm is to keep track of characters previously seen in an input source. 
If a string of characters has previously appeared within the sliding window, store a pointer back to where
the string occurs in the window. The pointer specifies where in the window to find the string and how many 
characters long the string is. 


## Quickstart
Clone this repository locally and run this `SlidingWindowCompression.java` program using a Java Editor such as BlueJ.
You must also use a hex editor because it allows you to view and edit the raw bytes of any file. To debug your lab output
you will very likely need the services of a hex editor so you can see your compressed files in binary form. This way 
you'll be able to see unprintable characters such as (char) 7, the audible bell.
